<img alt="Delivering Technical pitches" src="../_images/2175.jpeg" />
<p>As obvious as the following points might sound, it is surprising how many times, I have seen this being totally missed out. Getting these rights set a really strong foundation for the presentation and more importantly help you approach it with so much more confidence and that will naturally show.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Chance favours the prepared mind.</p>
<p><em>Louis Pasteur, Microbiologist, Chemist and Inventor Lecture, University of Lille (December 7, 1854)</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="know-your-why">
<h2>Know your why?<a class="headerlink" href="#know-your-why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Worth starting with the clarity in knowing your audience, their motivations, the key message you want to land, and most importantly why would they care to listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p>There was a lot of ground covered in the statement above - let me try and unpack that a bit. Your audience typically would have several conflicting priorities and each one of them would come with its fair share of distractions. Unless you are the only person on the planet who has the answer to their most pressing problem, which is highly unlikely - you will have to make the effort to constantly work on getting and keeping the attention. A meaningful engagement and hence knowing the answers to the questions asked above are going to be key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-much-time-do-you-have">
<h2>How much time do you have?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-much-time-do-you-have" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my coaching conversations - the number of times that has come up is surprisingly high - The time for the entire meeting - is never the entire time for you to present. The presentation itself isn’t the meeting. An engagement typically involves, (a late start, technical glitches - since we are all remote - this is 2021 after all), introductions, landing an idea (which is where you present), get feedback, prioritization call, and agreement of next steps - perhaps even owners for them.</p>
<p>If you look at the bigger picture, it is evident - for a meaningful engagement - the time that should be dedicated to delivering a technical presentation should be in the context of everything else that needs to happen. Plan that duration and accordingly tweak the content of the medium you plan on using for the presentation</p>
<p>This part is obviously applicable in the context of a pre-sales engagement and not where you are only delivering a technical presentation in a pre-arranged slot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-your-storyline">
<h2>What is your storyline?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-your-storyline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Have a storyline - a story has a start - the big idea, the big opportunity, or an impending threat, what is the cost of inaction? what you are suggesting can happen and change the world for them, save them from the threat or help them be amongst the first to benefit from the opportunity - and then the end - how will you go about implementing this with them should they choose to work with you.</p>
<p>Executives, key decision-makers usually have a lot on their mind - talking to them about an opportunity they can get excited about or a threat that is likely to affect their industry is something that is usually top of mind for them. You have a better chance of getting a buy-in if you can help them understand a clear risk-free approach to either the threat or the opportunity. Additionally, help them set the expectations on how realistic is the suggested approach and if it makes business sense (which is a whole topic in itself).</p>
<p>It all comes down to thinking through what your storyline is going to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customer-stories-engage-in-storytelling">
<h2>Customer Stories - Engage in storytelling<a class="headerlink" href="#customer-stories-engage-in-storytelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Stories are always more interesting than facts. Ask anyone and they will tell you - it’s more entertaining to know how a company invented a product, than the feature specifications of the product. Talking about customers just like the audience, who had a problem, just like theirs - what their challenges were, how they approached to solve it, and what value did they get out of it - is you should consider approaching it.</p>
<p>Invest in spending some time ahead of the presentation to get some more context about a relatable customer story. Take a moment to go into some level of detail with your prospect - That will inspire the art of possible, the opportunity for them, and the confidence that this has been done before and hence can be done for them again.</p>
<p>Use the storytelling to convey the impact of your solution, technology, etc., and take your time to tell it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="back-your-stats">
<h2>Back your stats!<a class="headerlink" href="#back-your-stats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Stats without context are merely marketing jargon. It is a very commonly used approach in most presentations with the idea to make an impact on the audience. Unfortunately where presenting stats from research falls short significantly, is where the speaker misses some key opportunities.</p>
<p>The first and and the most critical one is around relability.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>55% of CIOs report that the responsibility of the next level of business growth lies on their shoulders.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t have quite as much an impact when speaking to a CIO of a pharma industry like you would if you said something like.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the year 2020 when the pharma industry was reeling under a massive supply/demand imbalance, we heard a number of your colleagues, CIOs from the top x pharma companies who told us that they feel the pressure to bring technology lead innovations to drive the next tranche of business growth</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Stats require three things - relatability (why should your audience care about it), context (when, why, and who were involved to put together the stat), and source attribution (to provide credibility that the research holds value)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relatable-content">
<h2>Relatable Content?<a class="headerlink" href="#relatable-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A technical solution could be horizontal - providing a framework and approach that can pretty much work across any industry. Examples of an excellent database, an extensible data warehouse are all great examples that pretty much each industry needs.</p>
<p>If your stakeholders work across multiple industries - e.g. consultants, technology executives who work in the advisory role, engineering executives who have a wider exposure to the range of industries would appreciate that. For them - they will have the opportunity to understand the art of possible and then apply them in the domain they are working on. Having said that - these presentations are usually helpful in case of building partnership relationships, buy-in for developing eco-systems, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand - for the vast majority of technical pitches, I have seen delivered in pre-sales don’t seem to exist without a natural affinity to an industry. Executives engaged in these conversations usually have several decades of experience in their specific industry domain. Hence understanding the problems, terminology, opportunities in that space make for a far more relatable conversation. Positioning your idea inline to either of the three in the context of the domain makes a much bigger impact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keep-the-text-images-and-colors-consistent-with-your-messaging">
<h2>Keep the text, images, and colors consistent with your messaging<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-the-text-images-and-colors-consistent-with-your-messaging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We all often leverage content put together by product marketing, internal enablement, external sources to save time. This introduces a subtle but very important challenge on the inconsistencies of tonality, messaging, and focus areas. To top it all, as you speak through it - the content covered adds another dimension to the messaging being conveyed. Keeping the messaging consistent via the various mediums will ensure that your audience follows through with your storyline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-overview-is-just-that">
<h2>An overview is just that!<a class="headerlink" href="#an-overview-is-just-that" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All good presentations - attempt to set the expectation of what to expect in the presentation and that is great! But an overview is to do a quick level set in terms of expectations and the opportunity for an early call out in case any minor tweaks to the agenda are required.</p>
<p>An optimum approach for covering an overview slide is to consider an overview slide, as just that - don’t give away all the details at the overview itself - leave your audience a little bit curious about what’s behind the detail while covering the scope - ideally leave it to just the outcome of what the audience is expecting to achieve. You are more likely to keep them hooked, rather than get the summary upfront and zone out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="don-t-be-a-slave-to-your-deck">
<h2>Don’t be a slave to your deck<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-be-a-slave-to-your-deck" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Often as we assemble slides to put together an idea, build a storyline and think about how we want to unveil the idea - it all falls flat in a meeting where your audience is impatient, and can’t sit through your presentation, before they ask questions. Worse off - the line of questioning can be such that it can totally take you off-course. However - a lot of times those conversations have very important clues of what is top of mind for your audience.</p>
<p>When this happens, take a moment to gather your thoughts, listen intently to what is being discussed, and think how your content can be made relatable to what is being discussed. If it isn’t possible, go off script - engage in a conversation - the presentation after all was just a medium to keep them engaged while having a conversation. These tend to happen more often than we would want - especially where there is a sense of urgency in the org. and  multiple providers have been asked to come and present solutions and hence the audience wants to get to the point.</p>
<p>It is impactful to feel confident about being able to go off-script - engage, align and address the audience with their concerns and to get there, starts off by not feeling like you need to be a slave to your deck</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keep-the-pace">
<h2>Keep the pace<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-the-pace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the world of instant gratification, fast pace information - we are all vying for the hardest to get commodity - attention. A good presentation is one where the pace of information is consistent and ongoing. Some really nice presentations assemble ideas via transitions so that that the audience is part of the building-up process of the narrative.</p>
<p>If you spend too much time speaking over a text-heavy static slide - the chances are you would have lost the attention to the next notification on your audience’s computer or phone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="don-t-fill-time">
<h2>Don’t fill time<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-fill-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Don’t spend time reading off the slides, assume the audience can read it - what you are saying should be adding additional points, key insights, perspectives beyond the obvious.</p>
<p>Imagine a slide saying</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This helps reduce cost</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>and the speaker also confirming that. Now imagine the same scenario - but this time the speaker says</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Imagine how you could now, consider funding other areas of your business - with the increased cash flow due to the impact to the bottom line - this solution can bring to your business</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These are a lot of things to cover in the basics - its perhaps very hard to keep all of them in mind too - but with practice, consistency and more importantly empathy for your audience will encourage you to speak for your audience - not to your audience - to help provide clarity, derisk, re-assure, show profit/value and win a business opportunity for yourself along the way.</p>
