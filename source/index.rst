Delivering Technical Pitches

I have been in software engineering roles for nearly `two decades <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajatpandit/>`_ and counting. Often - in the role, I would come across an idea that could be game-changing for the business, a new way to look at the problem, or a great opportunity. To do anything that required more than my own sweat equity in an organization, it took getting greater buy-in from a wider set of stakeholders. I have had my fair share of opportunities and will perhaps continue to have them - and over the years I also had a fair share of success and failures to get the support of these internal stakeholders

Incidentally - in my current role in the cloud pre-sales business, there is a similar need to be able to present a technical point of view with different perspectives based audiences with different areas of concerns and focus. Over the year I have had the fine fortune to see several excellent presentations and some god-awful ones too - I wondered if there was some value to be created by documenting my unfair advantage to stop patterns by getting to watch, coach a team, and also learn from some brilliant presentations.

This ebook/journal/blog is an attempt to capture those ideas and share them with the pre-sales, consultants, solutions architects, and pretty much anyone who would see value in it and help them gain the confidence, ideas and tips to sharpen their narrative as they prepare for the big pitch.

If you find it useful, have other ideas, comments, feedback etc. don't forget to add comments at the bottom - or even better, you could contribute to this ebook by submitting pull requests for your ideas.
